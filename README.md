Tic-tac-toe, also known as 'noughts and crosses' or 'Xs and Os' or '*jogo da velha*' or '*jogo do galo*' or 'three in line' and many other names, this classic game is back again and you can play against your own machine.

Make a sequence of 'O' (horizontally, vertically or diagonally) and do not allow the machine to form the sequence of 'X'. Otherwise the machine will beat you.
